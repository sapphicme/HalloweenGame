i made a small maze in Godot 4 
it was an idea bumping around in my head for a while 
i wanted to challenge myself to make something in 36 hours and this is what I made 
I'm slowly adding things I think would be fun so any extra commits are for my own learning and joy
it's a small personal project and will likely never end up as a paid game nor will I complete it
